Morabe – Real Estate Investment Platform

Welcome to Morabe!
Morabe is a platform designed to make investing in construction projects easy and flexible. Admins can register projects that need funding, and users can invest in land in any amount they want—even less than one square meter. Every investment generates digital assets, which can later be sold to other users at prices approved by the admin.

What You Can Do on Morabe

Register and Verify Your Identity
Sign up, upload a short video for identity verification, and wait for the admin to approve your account. Once approved, you can start investing and trading.

Invest in Land Easily
Buy land in small or large amounts depending on your budget. The platform allows everyone to participate, even with minimal investment.

Manage Your Digital Assets
Every investment gives you digital assets representing your land. You can sell parts of these assets to other users at admin-approved prices.

Keep Track of Projects
Admins regularly update project progress with photos, completed area, supervisors, and more. You can see the progress of the projects you invest in.

Use Your Wallet & Payment Gateway
Each user has a personal wallet. You can top it up using the ZarinPal payment gateway and pay for your investments directly.

Collaboration with Architecture Companies
Architecture companies can request to join Morabe. The admin can invite selected companies to contribute and collaborate on projects.
